  _description: "Okuma is a real wizard. Whenever the gang needs money, he pulls
    out his phone \u2013 and the money appears right out of thin air! Yes, a kaikei
    keeps the gang\u2019s money, but you shouldn\u2019t think that Okuma\u2019s life
    is full of routine. When needed, he fights like a skilled fighter."
