  _name: Walter Black
  _description: "This former chemistry teacher has never had much luck with money.
    Once, his wife needed expensive treatment, and he didn\u2019t find a better way
    out than resorting to the help of the Cartel. Now he makes drugs. An upstanding
    man in general, Walter tries to preserve the last bits of humanity in himself,
    but the harsh criminal world forces him to compromise every day. Walter is not
    sure if he is still the same person that knocked on the Cartel\u2019s door several
    years ago."
