  _name: Raider Queen
  _description: Nobody knows her name. Some do not even believe that she is real,
    as the wasteland is no place for a woman. But there are unfortunates here and
    there telling horrific stories about bloodthirsty raiders and their steel four-wheeled
    monsters who leave no stone unturned and take away anything of value. They are
    led by an Amazon with a shotgun who never misses.
