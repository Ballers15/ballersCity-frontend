  _description: "Henry once made a fabulous fortune by smuggling, but then he crossed
    the path of some powerful people. The funny thing is that an ordinary yacht became
    the real stumbling block. First, it \u2013 being not put on the declaration \u2013
    showed up in Glenn Myers\u2019 social network, then Chekhov\u2019s bank tried
    to arrest it, and it all ended with an obvious setup \u2013 a dead body on its
    deck\u2026 Henry fled to the Harbor. He has lost everything except for the yacht
    that he still uses for smuggling while still dreaming of returning to high society."
