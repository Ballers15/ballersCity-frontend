  _description: "There are thousands of ways to get rid of a witness, but asking
    Charon for help is the best one. Bones can be dug out, a single hair is enough
    to get DNA, but the sea\u2026 The sea keeps secrets like no one else. Those who
    find themselves in the hold of Charon\u2019s ship never come back. And \u2013
    an amazing coincidence! \u2013 the police abandons searches for these unfortunates
    faster than usual. Charon is not surprised by this fact, he believes in the mystical
    power of the sea."
