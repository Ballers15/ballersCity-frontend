  _description: "Ju loves cats and killing. A simple migrant from North Korea, she
    went a long way from a cheap call-girl to the most expensive courtesan. But contract
    killing is her bread and butter. People know Ju\u2019s face well, but it doesn\u2019t
    help anyone, as she is a master of disguise. In her mansion, where she lives
    with dozens of cats, she keeps thousands of costumes, dresses and makeup bags
    which help her change not just her appearance, but height and even age."
