  _name: Joseph Diamond
  _description: "There is no lawyer in the world richer and more powerful than Joseph
    Diamond. He managed to set free absolute villains who seemed to have no chances
    in the court. Once at a local caf\xE9, Joseph underpaid for a cocktail which
    raised claims of the bartender. After a short dialogue, the bartender owed Joseph
    a tidy sum of money. And the caf\xE9 had to be closed."
