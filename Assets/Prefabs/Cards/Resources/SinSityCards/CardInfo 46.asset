  _name: Fernando Luciano
  _description: "Fernando is Giovanni Luciano\u2019s blood brother, but he has an
    absolutely different fate. Unlike his brother, he ignored the Family and set
    out to conquer the slums. There are no dons or kings there, and large machetes
    have replaced guns. Fernando is quite happy with this \u2013 he sees some sort
    of romance in it. Today he is the local Robin Hood who fights a never-ending
    war against big landowners."
