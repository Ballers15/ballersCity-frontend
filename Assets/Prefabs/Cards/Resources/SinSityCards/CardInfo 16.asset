  _name: Frederik Cranium
  _description: The most secret employee of the most secret laboratory who practically
    never leaves it, Frederik has been fond of unusual weaponry since childhood.
    While still a child, he invented a hand-held mortar to kill ants, a flashlight-gun
    and the notorious garrote-necktie. Today he manages about a hundred of projects
    for the production of weapons that can kill people in the most unexpected ways.
