  _description: "Rich people like to dress well \u2013 natural fabrics, fur, leather\u2026
    That means Pepe will have to roll up his sleeves and do his job. The Harbor is
    crawling with poachers, but Pepe is the best of them. He knows his way around
    both fish and animals. He is smart, patient and fearless. But he always says
    that there is one beast that he will not approach for any money. Moreover, it
    was prohibited by the court in the divorce process."
