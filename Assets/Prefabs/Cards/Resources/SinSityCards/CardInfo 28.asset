  _description: "One of the most respected influencers in Chinatown. It\u2019s been
    five years since he\u2019s joined the Dragon\u2019s Ear gang, and six years since
    he\u2019s got a degree in philology. A leading specialist in phonosemantics,
    semiotics, and psycholinguistic sciences, Hao Niubi is the man who makes up numerous
    secret signs, words, handshakes, and even rituals for the triads. Sometimes gang
    bosses do think that he simply cheats them, but they prefer to keep it to themselves
    \u2013 after all, a tradition is still a tradition."
