  _name: Lucas Peak
  _description: He is the local Sheriff. He handles a horse like a god, shoots better
    than any sniper, drinks like a fish and never gets drunk. All these amazing skills
    can be explained by the fact that Lucas was an outlaw for 15 years himself. It
    all changed the day when his pregnant wife died. The Wild West became a quieter
    place after his transformation, as any bandit knows that no one can find and
    kill him as quickly as another bandit.
