  _description: "The Master\u2019s real name is now forgotten, as he is the oldest
    man in Chinatown. He can\u2019t lift a sword, he shoots poorly, and he can\u2019t
    run at all, but he is still valued and respected. Why wouldn\u2019t he, since
    lotuses come from under his fingers looking like real ones, and dragons seem
    to move on their own! This old man is the greatest tattoo master, both here and
    back home. Despite his impressive age, his hands never shake, and his eyes are
    as sharp as they used to be in his youth."
