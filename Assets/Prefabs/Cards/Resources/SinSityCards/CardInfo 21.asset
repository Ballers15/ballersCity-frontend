  _description: "An average citizen often associates banking activity solely with
    currencies and securities. Deposit boxes spring to mind only in case one urgently
    needs a safe place to keep a newly bought necklace. This is the moment when Roselle
    Oberon \u2013 like a deus ex machina \u2013 comes in to calm down any paranoia.
    Her businesslike fairies dressed in formal suits will hide away any valuables
    so well that even Tiger won\u2019t get to them."
