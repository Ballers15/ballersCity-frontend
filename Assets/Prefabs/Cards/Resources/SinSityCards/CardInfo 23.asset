  _name: Henry Two Eagles
  _description: "As a representative of the endangered tribes of local aborigines,
    Henry Two Eagles lives to protect their rights. When he finds out that any of
    the small people is harassed, Henry won\u2019t leave the offenders in peace till
    they make a public apology. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t care about laws,
    since \u2013 as he himself claims \u2013 all of them have been established by
    white Republicans."
