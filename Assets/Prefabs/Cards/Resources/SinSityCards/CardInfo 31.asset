  _name: Insane Max
  _description: "No one knows where he came from. And asking Max himself is not an
    option. Max doesn\u2019t talk to people. He talks to cars only. He\u2019s obsessed
    with cars and knows well that the wasteland is a perfect place for this business.
    Max is an excellent mechanic and racer. His trusted men organize bloody races,
    where daredevils fight for the second place, as the first one is always taken
    by Max himself."
