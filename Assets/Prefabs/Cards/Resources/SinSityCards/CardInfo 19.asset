  _name: Tiger
  _description: "He is a unique robber for Little Swiss. At least once a month Tiger
    and his gang prove that no super protected facility equipped with drones, electronic
    tracking devices and a satellite targeting system can withstand an ordinary pickaxe
    and some dynamite. The more complicated a security system is, the simpler and
    more genius will be his choice of robbery methods. Tiger reached the peak of
    his skills when he imitated an attempt of breaking into the vault of a large
    bank so that later he could get into it with his gang under the disguise of the
    police and get out several bags with \u201Cphysical evidence\u201D."
