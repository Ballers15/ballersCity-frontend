  _description: "Many boast that they get money out of thin air, but Void went further
    and made a fortune on vacuum. He is a hereditary insurer. Having risen on the
    establishment of health insurance companies, he then expanded his field of activities
    to life and health insurance for rich gangsters. Now Void tries himself in the
    insurance of digital products. His start was quite unsuccessful \u2013 with Tamagotchi,
    he lost almost half of his fortune when the pets died."
