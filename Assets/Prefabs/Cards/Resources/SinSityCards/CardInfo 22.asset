  _name: "Joe \u201CZealot\u201D"
  _description: "Joe is a typical train robber in the Wild West, and he\u2019s proud
    of it. God knows what he would do, if the railroad from Little Swiss to the Silicon
    Valley didn\u2019t run through his area. But there are no other roads between
    the two locations because of the mountain range. Joe is a real fan of expensive
    phones and robs trains only to get new gadgets. And he is always happy to make
    a selfie with some tourists in a saloon on his new iPhone."
