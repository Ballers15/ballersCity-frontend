  _name: Jesus Escobar
  _description: 'The notorious drug lord himself with all the typical attributes:
    chronic paranoia, insomnia, passion for politics, ability to get away with anything,
    and absolute power within his criminal structure. Jesus thinks he is bewitched,
    as he survived three raids of the Security Service and nine murder attempts.
    When he was young, an old Haitian woman predicted he would die of a stale paella.'
