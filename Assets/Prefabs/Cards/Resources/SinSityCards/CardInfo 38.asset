  _description: "Once engaged in the trade of stolen goods, Luth couldn\u2019t even
    imagine that he would become the largest antique and luxury goods dealer one
    day. He is known for his hysterical nature and sometimes even cries like a little
    girl, but he does business with the severity of a real businessman. If you ordered
    some expensive clothes or jewelry of a limited collection, rest assured \u2013
    he\u2019ll get them for you, even if they belong to someone else now."
