  _name: "Kesha \u201CNail\u201D"
  _description: "Kesha was still in high school when he broke the jaw of a district
    police officer. After that incident, there was only one path left for him, taking
    into account the fact that local thugs valued his heroic deed high. Kesha is
    not allowed to take part in any serious business so far, but he\u2019s not in
    a hurry. Although he now has a nice habit of gazing at the jaw of an FSB officer
    living nearby through the window of his black BMW\u2026"
