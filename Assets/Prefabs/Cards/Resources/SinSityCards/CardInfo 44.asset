  _name: Quentin Sanders
  _description: "The owner of the biggest casinos in \u201CThe Strip\u201D, a millionaire
    and a sworn enemy of the famous thief Denny Deep, he works like a robot and sleeps
    three hours a day. He is well-known for his vicious hatred of casino robbers.
    The last unfortunate who made an attempt to steal Sanders\u2019 money didn\u2019t
    just go to jail. His entire family was ruined and had to beg for a living. That\u2019s
    the principle of this old gambling dealer: if you mess with Sanders, you and
    those who you love will all suffer."
