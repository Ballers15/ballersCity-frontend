  _description: "There has always been a strong connection between rap music and
    gang culture. Poor guys living in working-class districts drew inspiration from
    rap, and Sniff Dogg made good money on it. All his songs are dedicated to various
    events and people of the underworld, and his last hit \u201CBabe, I Want Your
    Snabadum!\u201D is addressed to the Drug Lord himself."
