  _description: "Don Vito Casso is respected for his hot temper and unprecedented
    cruelty. You should have seen what he\u2019s done to the last businessman who
    didn\u2019t pay him! Sometimes his competitors choose to take a bullet, because
    everyone knows \u2013 dying in a shooting with Vito\u2019s people is better than
    falling into his hands."
