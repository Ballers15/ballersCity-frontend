  _description: "Growing coca and making drugs is just part of the job. Drugs have
    to be sold somehow. That\u2019s what Escobar\u2019s aunt Angie Barreru does.
    She used to bend her back on plantations in the past, and she didn\u2019t lose
    her skills. She plants her infiltrators in the neighboring areas, just like seeds,
    helping them take root in the local criminal world. After a while, a network
    of loyal people, like mycelium, spreads all over the area and turns into a powerful
    trafficking organization."
