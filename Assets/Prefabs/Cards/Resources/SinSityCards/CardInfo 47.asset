  _description: "It all started with Argentine tango. But you need a partner for
    tango. Then he turned to samba, lundu, frevo, bossa nova\u2026 Ronaldo became
    popular, earned a lot of money dancing and took part in many festivals and competitions.
    The only thing that could stop him was broken legs. At least that\u2019s what
    his competitors thought. But by the time someone finally dared to approach Ronaldo,
    he mastered capoeira\u2026"
