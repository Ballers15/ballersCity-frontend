  _description: "Who hasn\u2019t seen a movie with this actor? He became so popular
    that took the place of the governor for a while! But those days are long gone.
    Arnie ended his career and settled on a paradise beach. However, that doesn\u2019t
    mean this popular actor is just chilling now. He went into real estate, and now
    he\u2019s taking over these lands as he used to take over the bad guys in his
    movies."
