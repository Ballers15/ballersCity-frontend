  _description: "An unremarkable person with unmemorable looks, he briefly appears
    at a gambling table here and there\u2026 and always wins. Since childhood, Yazon
    has mastered psychokinesis and knows how to \u201Cpersuade\u201D dice. He is
    very cautious and never tries to win too much. His innate delicacy helps him
    avoid the attention of dealers and croupiers."
