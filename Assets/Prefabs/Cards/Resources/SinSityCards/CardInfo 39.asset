  _description: "If you need a vintage dress or gothic shoes \u2013 feel free to
    contact Morgana. She\u2019s a gifted fashion designer, and her biggest weakness
    is leather goods. Morgana is very cautious in her business, but once a very pushy
    detective got too curious. However, he went missing soon after that, and a week
    later Morgana was seen in a new leather coat\u2026"
