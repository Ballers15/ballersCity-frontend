  _description: "Officially, Rocinha is not a member of any gang. No one knows her
    goals, patrons or allies. But sometimes, at a high point of a turf war, people
    may see a girl dressed as Carmen with two Uzis in her hands spinning around amidst
    fire and smoke and then disappearing into thin air. After that, the Favela becomes
    peaceful, at least for a little while. Old folks say that she is the soul of
    the Favela that comes into its streets to calm down its children in the most
    merciful way\u2026"
