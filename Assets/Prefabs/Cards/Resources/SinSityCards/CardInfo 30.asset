  _description: "Triads are conservative and patriotic, after all it\u2019s the oldest
    \u201Cmafia\u201D not without a reason. But times change, and a girl named Mo
    Li Hua, a political activist and environmentalist, became the head of a new gang.
    She dyes her hair using most unusual colors, gets non-traditional tattoos and
    has face piercings. A strange gang like that would not live a day, but \u2013
    quite unexpectedly \u2013 the new triad won public support which forced old bandits
    to accept the insolent girl as an equal."
