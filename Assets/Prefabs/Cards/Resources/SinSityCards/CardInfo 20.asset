  _description: "Yes, he is the husband of the famous Natalie Grossbaum. A third-generation
    banker, known as the greediest businessman, he owns a large network of banks
    specialized in mortgage lending.  Aaron earns less than his spouse, but his expenses
    are even lesser. Their relationships with the wife are quite frosty, but he doesn\u2019t
    want to divorce, as it requires paying a state fee."
