  _description: "Vanilla has always stood out for her sharp mind and creativity.
    When she came to the Red-Light District, she realized very quickly that it would
    be hard and dangerous to try and get into this market divided into spheres of
    influence long ago. So the girl chose an unusual field of activity that everyone
    liked. Aphrodisiacs, stimulants, soft drugs for every taste \u2013 Vanilla has
    all of them, and a vanilla cake as a bonus."
