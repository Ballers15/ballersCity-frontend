  _name: Eva Wagner
  _description: She is a typical geek, trans person and introvert who has made her
    way to wealth and glory with the help of programming code. Fellow workers jokingly
    say that Eva has always been here, and the Valley has been built around her desk.
    Recently, Eva has started developing algorithms for neural networks that collect
    information about user preferences. She also has a secret database that contains
    information about the most shameful addictions of the Valley inhabitants.
