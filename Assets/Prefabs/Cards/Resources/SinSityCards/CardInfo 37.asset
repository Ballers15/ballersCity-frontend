  _name: Estella Queen
  _description: "She is the fashion queen, a brilliant fashion designer and an odious
    person. Owners of the biggest fashion houses and luxury goods dealers line up
    to order a new trinket or clothes which become a work of art once she makes them.
    If they only knew how Estella had achieved all that\u2026 She blackmailed, kidnapped,
    killed people and even animals! Victims laid in the foundation of her podium
    number in the hundreds."
